Poker bot implemented in F#
---------------------------

For some information over this code please read my blog posts
of **Building a Poker Bot** series where I describe my experience 
developing bot software to play in online poker rooms. I'm building 
the bot with .NET framework and F# language which makes the task relatively 
easy and very enjoyable. Here are the published parts:
